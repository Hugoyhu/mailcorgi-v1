Hello!

MailCorgi is built as a replacement for Maildog, Hack Club's legacy Airtable/Zapier powered bot for Hack Club Mail Team. 

MailCorgi is written in python, using Supabase as a database. 

MailCorgi requires a supabase db set up. You can probably figure out how the tables look like by looking at the code, but I'll be happy to dig up the table and column names out, should you need it.
This project is a WIP. It is jumbled together to the point where I don't know how it works. It has nearly 0 code comments, and you may have a hard time figuring out what's happening.

Mailcorgi requires these python packages(available via pip)
shippo, supabase_py, slack-bolt, and reportlab.

Early on, I discovered a case where the application had a critical error(don't remember), but uninstall dataclasses, that will fix the issue.
